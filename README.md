# System-Analysis-and-Design
Sample of work from System Analysis and Design course


#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a project where we assumed the role of a contractor working in system analysis and design tasked to help the company DriverPass design a system meant to help students pass their driving exams. The system needed to allow students to view course materials, take practice exams, and make one-on-one reservations with a driving instructor for on the road lessons.
    
#What did you do particularly well?
As far as what I did particularly well in this project, I believe that would be my work on interpreting the clients needs to come up with the use cases that the system needed to support. I also believe I did a good job at breaking down this analysis for the client (DriverPass) in a non-technical presentation where I made it clear that the design choices were built around the needs presented by the client and none of their needs were left unconsidered.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had to pick one part of my work to revise it would be my work on describing the technical requirements and tools and infrastructure necessary to implement those requirements. As this was my first experience with system design (up until this point, my coursework has focused on programming skills) I feel like my description of the technical requirements and infrastructure needed was lacking in detail and not comprehensive. I've learned a lot from this project and I believe I'm well on my way to learning what I really need to know to create a comprehensive design for a system like this. It would be interesting to come back and update some of these documents after I've learned a bit more about system design (and maybe done some work as an intern).
    
#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by paying close attention to what the client was saying they needed from their system and extrapolating those needs out to a degree. I made sure to review the transcript where the client detailed their needs multiple times while working on this project to make sure I wasn't missing anything.
    
#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In the future, I would approach designing software in much the same way we did in this course. I would begin by making a detailed list of the user's needs. From there, I would create a comprehensive list of use cases and actors involved in the system and I would create a requirements document where I could list out all of the functional and non-functional requirements based on the detailed list of user needs. The requirements document was extremely helpful and my future approach to designing a system would revolve around the work done in a requirements document. For any use cases that are fairly complex, I would create activity and sequence diagrams to help clarify how the use cases would work and what infrastructure needs to be in place to support them.
